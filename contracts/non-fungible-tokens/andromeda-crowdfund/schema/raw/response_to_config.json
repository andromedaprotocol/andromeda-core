Inspired by the cosmwasm-std `Addr` type. https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/2a1c698520a1aacedfe3f4803b0d7d653892217a/packages/std/src/addresses.rs#L33\n\nThis address can be one of two things: 1. A valid human readable address e.g. `cosmos1...` 2. A valid Andromeda VFS path e.g. `/home/user/app/component`\n\nVFS paths can be local in the case of an app and can be done by referencing `./component` they can also contain protocols for cross chain communication. A VFS path is usually structured as so:\n\n`<protocol>://<chain (required if ibc used)>/<path>` or `ibc://cosmoshub-4/user/app/component`",
      "type": "string"
    }
