# Andromeda Fixed Multisig ADO

## Introduction

The Andromeda Fixed Multisig ADO is a governance contract that enables multiple parties to collectively control and execute transactions through a democratic voting process. This contract implements a fixed-voter multisignature system where a predefined set of voters with assigned weights must reach consensus before executing proposals. The multisig provides secure shared ownership, decentralized decision-making, and transparent governance for critical operations in DeFi protocols, DAOs, and multi-party applications.

<b>Ado_type:</b> fixed-multisig

## Why Fixed Multisig ADO

The Fixed Multisig ADO serves as essential governance infrastructure for applications requiring:

- **Shared Ownership**: Multiple parties controlling critical assets and operations
- **Decentralized Governance**: Democratic decision-making through weighted voting
- **Security Enhancement**: Protection against single points of failure and unauthorized actions
- **Treasury Management**: Collective control over fund movements and allocations
- **Protocol Governance**: Managing protocol upgrades and parameter changes
- **Multi-Party Custody**: Shared custody of high-value assets and smart contracts
- **Risk Mitigation**: Preventing unilateral actions through consensus requirements
- **Transparent Operations**: Public voting records and proposal tracking
- **Flexible Thresholds**: Configurable voting requirements for different use cases
- **Time-Based Controls**: Expiration-based proposal management for timely decisions

The ADO provides robust voting mechanisms, proposal management, and execution controls with full transparency and auditability.

## Key Features

### **Weighted Voting System**
- **Fixed voter set**: Predefined list of voters with assigned voting weights
- **Weighted decisions**: Each voter's influence proportional to their assigned weight
- **Threshold-based approval**: Configurable voting thresholds for proposal passage
- **Democratic process**: Fair and transparent voting mechanisms
- **Weight validation**: Automatic validation of voter weights and thresholds

### **Proposal Management**
- **Proposal creation**: Any voter can create proposals with title, description, and actions
- **Action bundling**: Multiple cosmos messages can be bundled in a single proposal
- **Expiration control**: Time-limited voting periods with configurable durations
- **Status tracking**: Real-time proposal status updates (Open, Passed, Rejected, Executed)
- **Execution automation**: Automatic execution of passed proposals

### **Voting Mechanisms**
- **Secure voting**: Only registered voters can participate in voting
- **Vote options**: Support for Yes, No, and Abstain votes
- **Single vote enforcement**: Prevent duplicate voting on the same proposal
- **Real-time tallying**: Automatic vote counting and threshold evaluation
- **Vote transparency**: Public voting records for full auditability

### **Security Features**
- **Access control**: Only voters can create proposals and vote
- **Execution protection**: Only passed proposals can be executed
- **Expiration enforcement**: Expired proposals cannot be voted on or executed
- **State validation**: Comprehensive validation of proposal states and transitions
- **Weight verification**: Continuous validation of voter weights and permissions

## Threshold Types

### **Absolute Count**
Fixed number of votes required regardless of total weight:
```rust
Threshold::AbsoluteCount { weight: 3 }
```

### **Absolute Percentage** 
Percentage of total voting weight required:
```rust
Threshold::AbsolutePercentage { 
    percentage: Decimal::percent(51) 
}
```

### **Threshold Majority**
More than 50% of total voting weight:
```rust
Threshold::ThresholdQuorum { 
    threshold: Decimal::percent(51),
    quorum: Decimal::percent(40) 
}
```

        }
    ]
}

### Treasury Management
For managing protocol treasuries:

1. **Deploy multisig** with trusted stakeholders as voters
2. **Set appropriate threshold** for security vs efficiency balance
3. **Create spending proposals** for fund allocations
4. **Vote on proposals** through decentralized governance
5. **Execute approved transfers** automatically

### Protocol Governance
For managing protocol upgrades:

1. **Establish governance council** with weighted voting rights
2. **Propose protocol changes** with detailed descriptions
3. **Allow voting period** for stakeholder input
4. **Execute upgrades** once consensus is reached
5. **Maintain transparency** through public voting records

### Multi-Party Custody
For shared asset custody:

1. **Set up multisig** with key stakeholders
2. **Require majority approval** for asset movements
3. **Use time-limited proposals** for urgent decisions
4. **Maintain audit trail** through proposal history
5. **Enable emergency procedures** through governance

### **Governance Protection**
- **Democratic process**: Fair and transparent voting mechanisms
- **Consensus requirement**: Require consensus before executing critical actions
- **Audit trail**: Complete audit trail for all governance decisions
- **Transparency**: Public visibility of all votes and proposals

## Important Notes

- **Fixed voter set**: Voter list is fixed at instantiation and cannot be changed
- **Weight immutability**: Voter weights cannot be modified after deployment
- **Single vote rule**: Each voter can only vote once per proposal
- **Execution requirement**: Proposals must reach "Passed" status before execution
- **Expiration enforcement**: Expired proposals cannot be voted on or executed
- **Public execution**: Anyone can execute a passed proposal, not just voters
- **Irreversible execution**: Executed proposals cannot be undone or re-executed
- **Threshold validation**: Threshold must be achievable with total weight

## Common Workflow

### 1. **Deploy Multisig**
```json
{
    "voters": [
        {"addr": "andr1voter1...", "weight": 1},
        {"addr": "andr1voter2...", "weight": 1},
        {"addr": "andr1voter3...", "weight": 1}
    ],
    "threshold": {"absolute_count": {"weight": 2}},
    "max_voting_period": {"time": 604800}
}
```

### 2. **Create Proposal**
```json
{
    "propose": {
        "title": "Budget Allocation",
        "description": "Allocate development budget",
        "msgs": [...],
        "latest": null
    }
}
```

### 3. **Cast Votes**
```json
{
    "vote": {
        "proposal_id": 1,
        "vote": "yes"
    }
}
```

### 4. **Check Status**
```json
{
    "proposal": {
        "proposal_id": 1
    }
}
```

### 5. **Execute Proposal**
```json
{
    "execute": {
        "proposal_id": 1
    }
}
```

### 6. **Verify Execution**
```json
{
    "proposal": {
        "proposal_id": 1
    }
}
```
