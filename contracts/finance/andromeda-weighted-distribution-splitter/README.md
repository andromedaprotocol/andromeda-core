# Andromeda Weighted Distribution Splitter ADO

## Introduction

The Andromeda Weighted Distribution Splitter ADO is an advanced financial distribution contract that automatically splits funds to specified recipients based on weighted proportions rather than fixed amounts. This contract enables sophisticated fund allocation where each recipient receives a percentage of the total funds based on their assigned weight relative to the total weight of all recipients. The splitter supports dynamic weight management, time-based locking, and flexible recipient administration, making it ideal for profit sharing, dividend distribution, weighted payment systems, and proportional allocation scenarios.

## Why Weighted Distribution Splitter ADO

The Weighted Distribution Splitter ADO serves as advanced financial infrastructure for applications requiring:

- **Profit Sharing**: Distribute profits proportionally based on ownership stakes or contribution weights
- **Dividend Distribution**: Automated dividend payments to shareholders based on their holdings
- **Revenue Sharing**: Split revenues among partners, employees, or stakeholders with weighted allocations
- **Investment Returns**: Distribute investment returns proportionally to investor contributions
- **Commission Structures**: Weighted commission distribution based on sales performance or seniority
- **Staking Rewards**: Distribute staking rewards proportionally to stake amounts
- **Royalty Distribution**: Split royalties among creators, publishers, and distributors
- **Pool Distributions**: Distribute funds from liquidity pools or reward pools based on participation
- **Performance Bonuses**: Allocate bonuses based on weighted performance metrics
- **Governance Rewards**: Distribute governance rewards based on voting power or participation

The ADO provides precise percentage-based control, dynamic weight management, and lock-time security for reliable proportional distribution operations.

## Key Features

### **Weighted Distribution Logic**
- **Proportional allocation**: Each recipient receives funds proportional to their weight
- **Dynamic weighting**: Weights can be updated, added, or removed when contract is unlocked
- **Precise calculations**: Mathematical precision in percentage-based distributions
- **Remainder handling**: Configurable handling of remainder funds after weighted distributions
- **Multi-token support**: Distribute multiple token types in a single operation

### **Flexible Weight Management**
- **Individual weight updates**: Update specific recipient weights without affecting others
- **Add/remove recipients**: Dynamic recipient list management with weight validation
- **Weight validation**: Ensure all weights are positive and meaningful
- **Total weight queries**: Query individual and total weights for transparency
- **Bulk recipient updates**: Replace entire recipient list when needed

### **Security and Lock Management**
- **Time-based locking**: Lock contract configuration for security periods
- **Configuration protection**: Prevent unauthorized configuration changes during lock
- **Owner controls**: Only contract owner can modify configuration and weights
- **Lock duration validation**: Validate lock periods for security compliance
- **Emergency unlocking**: Automatic unlocking after lock period expires

### **Advanced Fund Handling**
- **Multi-coin support**: Handle up to 5 different token types per distribution
- **Native token support**: Full support for native blockchain tokens
- **Default recipient**: Configure default recipient for remainder funds
- **AMP integration**: Full integration with Andromeda Messaging Protocol
- **Atomic operations**: All distributions occur atomically or fail completely

## Weight Calculation Logic

### **Proportional Distribution**
The contract distributes funds based on weighted proportions:
1. **Calculate total weight** of all recipients
2. **Determine proportions** for each recipient (recipient_weight / total_weight)
3. **Calculate distributions** for each token type and recipient
4. **Send weighted amounts** to respective recipients
5. **Handle remainders** according to default recipient configuration

### **Mathematical Formula**
For each recipient and token:
```
recipient_amount = total_amount Ã— (recipient_weight / total_weight)
```

### **Remainder Handling**
Due to rounding in percentage calculations:
- **Remainder funds**: Any remaining tokens after weighted distribution
- **Default recipient**: Send remainders to configured default recipient
- **Fallback to sender**: If no default recipient, return to original sender
- **Multi-token support**: Handle remainders for each token type separately

### Revenue Sharing System
For automated revenue distribution:

1. **Deploy splitter** with stakeholder addresses and weights
2. **Lock configuration** for quarterly periods
3. **Execute distributions** when revenue is collected
4. **Update weights** based on changing ownership or contributions
5. **Handle remainder funds** through company treasury

### Investment Fund Distribution
For proportional investment returns:

1. **Set investor weights** based on investment amounts
2. **Configure quarterly lock periods** for stability
3. **Distribute returns** proportionally to investments
4. **Update investor lists** when new investors join
5. **Track individual allocations** through weight queries

### Team Incentive Programs
For performance-based team rewards:

1. **Define team member weights** based on roles and performance
2. **Set monthly distribution cycles** through lock management
3. **Distribute incentives** based on team performance metrics
4. **Adjust weights** based on performance reviews
5. **Add/remove team members** as team composition changes

### DAO Treasury Management
For decentralized fund allocation:

1. **Configure workstream allocations** with appropriate weights
2. **Set governance-approved lock periods** for fund security
3. **Execute treasury distributions** based on DAO decisions
4. **Update allocations** through governance proposals
5. **Manage fund remainders** through DAO treasury
